      <pre class="Author-desc-i">
        Gabriel García Márquez (1927–2014) was a Colombian
        novelist, journalist, and Nobel Prize winner, widely
        regarded as one of the greatest writers of the 20th
        century. He is best known for pioneering the genre
        of magical realism, where fantastical elements are
        woven into realistic settings. His most famous work,
        One Hundred Years of Solitude, has become a landmark
        of world literature. Through his writing, García Márquez
        explored themes of love, solitude, power, and the
        complexities of Latin American life</pre>

    <p class="book-description">The brilliant, bestselling, landmark novel that tells the story of the Buendia family, and chronicles the irreconcilable conflict between the desire for solitude and the need for love—in rich, imaginative prose that has come to define an entire genre known as "magical realism."</p>
    <h2 class="book-description-title">Review: </h2>
    <p class="book-description">Gabriel García Márquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude is a literary masterpiece that stands as a pillar of magical realism, blending the extraordinary with the everyday in a way that feels both dreamlike and profoundly human. The novel traces the rise and fall of the Buendía family in the fictional town of Macondo, capturing the sweeping arcs of history, myth, and emotion across generations.

      What makes this novel brilliant isn't just the poetic prose or the imaginative events—flying carpets, ghosts, plagues of insomnia—but how deeply it explores the human condition. Márquez captures the conflict between solitude and love with remarkable insight, showing how the Buendías, in their pursuit of meaning, knowledge, and passion, often fall victim to isolation and repetition.
      
      Each character is vividly drawn, yet they often feel like echoes of one another, reinforcing the cyclical nature of time and destiny in the novel. The intergenerational saga is both epic and intimate, weaving personal tragedies with grand allegories of Latin American history.
      
      Richly layered and stylistically daring, One Hundred Years of Solitude is not just a book—it’s an experience. It demands attention and patience, but the reward is unforgettable: a profound, beautiful meditation on memory, identity, and the inescapable loops of human life.</p>

      <p class="Author-desc-i">
        Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald (September 24, 1896 – December 21, 1940)widely known simply as Scott Fitzgerald, was an American novelist, essayist, and short story writer. He is best known for his novels depicting the flamboyance and excess of the Jazz Age, a term he popularized in his short story collection Tales of the Jazz Age. During his lifetime, he published four novels, four story collections, and 164 short stories. Although he achieved temporary popular success and fortune in the 1920s, Fitzgerald received critical acclaim only after his death and is now widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century.</p>

    <h2 class="book-description-title">Description: </h2>
    <p class="book-description">The novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King, and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island's North Shore in 1922. Following a move to the French Riviera, Fitzgerald completed a rough draft of the novel in 1924. He submitted it to editor Maxwell Perkins, who persuaded Fitzgerald to revise the work over the following winter. After making revisions, Fitzgerald was satisfied with the text, but remained ambivalent about the book's title and considered several alternatives. Painter Francis Cugat's dust jacket art, named Celestial Eyes, greatly impressed Fitzgerald, and he incorporated its imagery into the novel.</p>
    <h2 class="book-description-title">Review: </h2>
    <p class="book-description">The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s third book, stands as the supreme achievement of his career. First published in 1925, this quintessential novel of the Jazz Age has been acclaimed by generations of readers. The story of the mysteriously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his love for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan, of lavish parties on Long Island at a time when The New York Times noted “gin was the national drink and sex the national obsession,” it is an exquisitely crafted tale of America in the 1920s.</p>

      <p class="book-description">Acclaimed by many as the world's greatest novel, Anna Karenina provides a vast panorama of contemporary life in Russia and of humanity in general. In it Tolstoy uses his intense imaginative insight to create some of the most memorable characters in all of literature. Anna is a sophisticated woman who abandons her empty existence as the wife of Karenin and turns to Count Vronsky to fulfil her passionate nature - with tragic consequences. Levin is a reflection of Tolstoy himself, often expressing the author's own views and convictions.

        Throughout, Tolstoy points no moral, merely inviting us not to judge but to watch. As Rosemary Edmonds comments, 'He leaves the shifting patterns of the kaleidoscope to bring home the meaning of the brooding words following the title, 'Vengeance is mine, and I will repay.</p>
      <h2 class="book-description-title">Review: </h2>
      <p class="book-description">Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy is a classic novel about love, betrayal, and societal expectations. It follows Anna’s tragic affair with Count Vronsky, set against the contrasting life of Levin, a man searching for purpose. Deep, emotional, and thought-provoking.</p>
